The is the second parenting social network that I am creating. The first of the two worked well, but it was not promoted enough, and had some functionality issues. This time I will be making this network to work in a way that will be easy to use; it will be more user friendly.

There is more that will be added soon to the lists to be done. There is much more I am sure that I am not thinking of now. 

This site is because there are many parents out there that would like answers in questions that come up when raising families. I don't think I have all these answers, but I know when we come together, the answers are there. 

Recently, I had my son tell me that he wanted to hang out with a friend of his from school. He did not know how to get ahold of this child though. I would still like to be able to find a way to make this happen. Instead of finding a way, I am making a way. Nowhere out there can you pull up a childs name that your child went to school with, and find the parents so that you can contact them. The main goal in this site is to make this happen. I want you to be able to look up the name of the child and it will pull up the parents profile. This will be an easy way to get into contact with those parents.

You will also be able to have an event for families. Maybe this could be a birthday party, or even a holiday grill out. When an event is created you send out invites to friends.
